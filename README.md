#Kite Academy

This project was my first solo exercise with Ruby on Rails. Other languages used include Ruby (obviously), HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap. As an avid kiter, I thought it would be fun to create an online kiteboarding instructional site. With this project, a user has the ability to add new levels of kiteboarding experience and lessons to complement them, in addition to editing and removing either lesson or level. A visitor has the ability to go through the lessons in sequential order by pressing the next button, or revist older lessons by pressing the previous button or going back to the home page where all the lessons are displayed.

Happy kiting, all!
